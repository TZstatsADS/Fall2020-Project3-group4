### Lib folder

The feature.ipynb file has functions that generate the starter code features, our improved features, the improved features modified with SMOTE, and the improved features modified with PCA.

The compute_metrics.ipynb file has a function that returns accuracy, balanced accuracy, and AUC when given a model, test predictions, and true labels.

The train notebooks train a model given a set of training features, training labels, and parameters. They return a trained model and the time it takes to train the model.

The test_model.ipynb has a test_model function that takes in a set of test features and a trained model. The function returns the test predictions and the time it takes to make the predictions.
